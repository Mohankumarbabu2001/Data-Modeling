Character-Level Recurrent Neural Network for Text Generation
Overview
This repository contains code for training a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate text sequences based on a given corpus of text data. The trained model can be used to generate new text character by character, leveraging the statistical patterns learned during training.

Getting Started
To use this code, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/example.git

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using pip install torch numpy.

Run the Code: Execute the provided Python script text_generation_rnn.py to train the RNN model on your text data and generate new text sequences.

Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare your text data and update the text variable in the provided code with your dataset.

Training: Run the code to train the RNN model on the prepared text data. Adjust hyperparameters such as the number of epochs and learning rate as needed.

Text Generation: After training, use the provided functions predict and sample to generate new text sequences. Specify a starting input and the desired length of the generated text.
